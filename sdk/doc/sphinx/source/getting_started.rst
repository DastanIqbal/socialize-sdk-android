Installing the SDK 
------------------
The Socialize SDK is delivered as a single JAR file, simply copy the socialize-x.x.x.jar file 
from the **dist** folder to the **libs** path of your Android project.

If you're using eclipse, you'll need to add the socialize-x.x.x.jar as a referenced library:

Socialize does not support Android versions below v2.1-update1
